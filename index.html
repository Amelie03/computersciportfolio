        <h2 id="hyd">Hydrologic Cycle</h2>
            <li>Most of life on Earth is primarily composed of water; our cells, and the cells of plants and animals are composed of about 70 percent water. Large amounts of water cycle though the land, oceans, and atmosphere over both a short and long time.</li>

            <li>When it rains  on land, some of it runs off into lakes and streams. Much of it seeps into the ground. This process is called infiltration. It is primarily during this stage of the hydrologic cycle that water is purified. Passing through layers of sediment and rock helps to filter pollutants out, allowing the pure water to pass through. </li>

            <li>Water that is not absorbed into the soil flows across the landscape to rivers, lakes, streams, and eventually to the oceans, as runoff. While some runoff waters come from rain or snow, others come from melting snow or ice.</li>

            <li>Rather than seep into the soil or into surface waters, some water returns to the air through evaporation. Evaporation  on land occurs on plants and is called transpiration. Evaporation and transpiration have coined a single term: evapotranspiration. The process in which water vapor is converted back into liquid is called condensation. An important type of condensation within the hydrologic cycle takes place in the atmosphere. As water vapor moves up in the atmosphere it cools down. This is called convection. The droplets gather together to form clouds. Depending on the temperature the cloud will contain either rain or snow.</li>
        <h2 id="pho">Phosphorus Cycle</h2>
            <li>Phosphorus is an important element for all forms of life. As phosphate, it holds DNA and RNA together. Like calcium, phosphorus is important in the human body, 80% of phosphorous is found in teeth and bones. The phosphorus biogeochemical cycle is prevalent in both the terrestrial ecosystem and the aquatic ecosystem , but both cycles are connected and are being damaged by humans.</li>

            <li>It is in the rocks of the terrestrial ecosystem where the phosphorus cycle begins. First, the newly formed rocks get uplifted and breach the surface of the crust. When it rains, phosphates are removed from the rocks by weathering and are distributed throughout soil and water. Plants take in the phosphate from the soil. The phosphates then move from plants to animals when herbivores eat plants and carnivores eat the herbivores. The phosphates absorbed by animal tissue through consumption, eventually return to the soil through feces. As well as through the decomposition of plants and animals after death.</li>

            <li>The same process occurs within the aquatic ecosystem. Phosphorus is not highly soluble, although it bonds to soil, because of this it mostly reaches waters by traveling with runoff soil particles. Phosphates also enter waterways through fertilizer runoff, sewage seepage, natural mineral deposits, and wastes from factories. As sediments are stirred up, phosphates may reenter the phosphorus cycle through the soil, but are usually available to aquatic organisms by being exposed through erosion. Water plants take up the phosphate from the water, which then travels up through the food chain.</li>

            <li>While phosphorus is very good in small amounts, in surface waters an excessive amount of phosphorus is considered a pollutant. Phosphate stimulates the growth of plankton and plants. Excess growth of these plants consume large amounts of dissolved oxygen, this can kill fish and other marine animals, while also blocking available sunlight to bottom dwelling species. Humans can alter the phosphorus cycle in many ways, especially through the use of agricultural fertilizers. Agricultural runoff provides much of the phosphate found in waterways. Crops often cannot absorb all of the fertilizer in the soils, causing excess fertilizer runoff and increasing phosphate levels in rivers and other bodies of water.</li>
        <h2 id="oxy">Oxygen Cycle</h2>
            <li>As everyone knows oxygen is very, if not the most important element for life. The element oxygen can be found everywhere. It is extremely reactive and can combine with other elements. Oxygen travels everywhere in; its O2 form, within water, and in carbon dioxide.</li>

            <li>There are many ways oxygen gets released or created, one of these many ways could be from the gasses that escape from weathering rocks. As a chemical reacts to an element in a rock, air may be formed and rise into the atmosphere. A second example is of course through photosynthesis. Plants take in carbon dioxide, and chlorophyll captures the Sun's energy and uses it to make energy out of the carbon dioxide. The byproduct of this process is oxygen, which floats up into the atmosphere. Now once in the atmosphere the oxygen may be used in respiration, breathing, or in combustion, something similar to fuel for a fire.</li>

            <li>Hydrogen and oxygen make up water, water flows through land and atmosphere via the water cycle. Water goes through evapotranspiration and rises to the atmosphere where it forms clouds and gets blown all over the Earth. Once the water gets rained down, it may get drunk by animals, get washed into a body of water, or absorbed by trees.</li>

            <li>Carbon dioxide is whatâ€™s breathed out by animals and humans. It is also a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels. As plants and animals decay, they too release carbon dioxide. The final way carbon dioxide cycles is when plants take in carbon dioxide to make energy.</li>        </div>
